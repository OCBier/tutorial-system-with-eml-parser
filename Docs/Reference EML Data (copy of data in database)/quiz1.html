            <QuestionHeading> Question 2</QuestionHeading>

             <CorrectOption><label>c. </label> Yes. A page may contain multiple heading elements to introduce different sections.</CorrectOption>
            <WrongOption><label>d. </label> Yes. But this is only true when the heading elements occur within an article element.</WrongOption>

            <QuestionHeading> Question 3</QuestionHeading>
            <QuestionText>Is there any reason why you shouldn't use &lt;input type = "e-mail"&gt;?</QuestionText>

             <CorrectOption><label>c. </label> A problem for some users is that it will not always handle non-Latin characters correctly. </CorrectOption>
            <WrongOption><label>d. </label> The input type is now deprecated, so it should be avoided.</WrongOption>

            <WrongOption><label>c. </label> An error message will be displayed to the user and it will not be possible to use the input.</WrongOption>

            <WrongOption><label>b. </label> It is used only as a child of an &lt;article&gt; and groups different sections of the article element.</WrongOption>
            <WrongOption><label>c. </label> It replaces the div element in HTML5 and is used in the layout of the page.</WrongOption>
            <WrongOption><label>d. </label> It is used to group different types of inputs in forms into logical sections. </WrongOption>

            <WrongOption><label>c. </label> Both b and d are correct.</WrongOption>
            <CorrectOption><label>d. </label> This may be done when the inner article is related to the outer one, although the inner one could exist independently.</CorrectOption>

            <WrongOption><label>a. </label> The increment is always by one and it is not possible to change this. </WrongOption>
            <CorrectOption><label>b. </label> This is done by setting the "step" attribute in the input tag to the desired amount. </CorrectOption>
            <WrongOption><label>c. </label> The increment is determined by changing the width property in the associated stylesheet or directly on the input element. </WrongOption>
            <WrongOption><label>d. </label> This is done by setting the "min" and "max" attributes on the element, so the browser can determine the appropriate granularity. </WrongOption>

            <WrongOption><label>b. </label> There is no standard approach since different browsers use different formats for storing datetime-local value. </WrongOption>
            <WrongOption><label>c. </label> This type uses the North American format which starts with month (Eg. 10-25-2017T05:30). </WrongOption>
            <CorrectOption><label>d. </label> A universal format is used to store input, starting with year in descending order (Eg. 2017-10-25T05:30). </CorrectOption>

         <MCQuestion>
            <QuestionHeading> Question 10</QuestionHeading>
            <QuestionText>HTML5 input validation is very convenient. But is it safe to rely on this alone when storing data?</QuestionText>
            <WrongOption><label>a. </label> Yes, it is safe in most cases. But it is sometimes necessary to use additional validation with JavaScript. </WrongOption>
            <WrongOption><label>b. </label> Yes it is safe. Additional validation is redundant.</WrongOption>
            <WrongOption><label>c. </label> No. JavaScript should always be used to validate data on the client before sending it to the server.</WrongOption>
            <CorrectOption><label>d. </label> No. The server must validate data as well, since validation on the client is not secure.</CorrectOption>
