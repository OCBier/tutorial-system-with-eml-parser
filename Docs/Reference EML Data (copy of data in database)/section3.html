			<Title>Section 3: AJAX And JSON</Title>
			<Summary>
			<Paragraph>This section looks at a specific application of JavaScript to transfer data in a universal format known as JSON. This is a very widely used
			approach for many different uses cases. We first look at the <Location link = "#json-format">#json-format </Location>  details of JSON and then show how it can be used with AJAX (see
			<Location link = "#using-ajax">#using-ajax</Location> ) to transfer
			data between the client and server asynchronously. This means that the page does not need to be reloaded. The main benefit here is that there is
			improved the performance. Using AJAX allows web applications to have the same (or at least similar) level of responsiveness compared to desktop apps.</Paragraph>

				<SubsectionHeading>JSON format</SubsectionHeading>
				<Paragraph>JSON stands for "JavaScript Object Notation" which makes sense because JSON syntax looks a lot like JavaScript objects.  However, JSON can be used with other languages 
				as well. The main advantages of JSON over XML, the other major data storage and transmission format for web applications, is that JSON is less complicated to work with
				directly in JavaScript and it is much smaller in size with a relatively simple syntax. On the other hand, XML has the advantage of supporting schemas for defining the 
				structure of data. This allows the data to be validated against the schema which is a description of the different data types and their structure.
				However, the trade-off is that the XML syntax is more complex. It usually requires more characters (and tokens) to represent the same information. </Paragraph>
				
				<Paragraph>The basic format for JSON uses an object with various attributes holding data. Attribute names are separated by colons, and different name:value pairs are separated by commas,
				as follows. Note that the quotation marks on attribute names are required in JSON, unlike normal JavaScript objects.</Paragraph>
				
				<CodeExample>
				<CodeText>
				
				var biz = {"color": "green", "shape": "square"}; 
				
				</CodeText>
				</CodeExample>
				
				<Paragraph>Within a .JSON file, this syntax could be used to produce an object named biz: </Paragraph>
				
				<CodeExample>
				<CodeText>
				
				{  "biz" : {"color": "green", "shape":"square"} }
				
				</CodeText>
				</CodeExample>
				
				<Paragraph>Each of the values in the JSON object can be accessed by name, like this:</Paragraph>
				
				<CodeExample>
				<CodeText>
				
				var baz = biz.color;   //Using dot notation.
				var foo = biz[shape];   //Using bracket notation.
				
				</CodeText>
				</CodeExample>
				
				<Paragraph>It is also possible to define an array of JSON objects in JavaScript as follows. Note the square brackets
				for array notation. Objects are separated by commas.:</Paragraph>
				<CodeExample>
				<CodeText>
				
				var shapes = 
				[ {"color": "green", "shape":"square"},
				  {"color": "red", "shape":"circle"}, 
				  {"color": "blue", "shape":"triangle" }];
				
				</CodeText>
				</CodeExample>
				
				<Paragraph>Each of the objects can be accessed using standard array index notation, giving access to the properties of each object. For
				example, we can access the 1st element and examine its properties like this:</Paragraph>
				
					
				<CodeExample>
				<CodeText>
				
				var myShape = shapes[0];               //Index 0 is first element using array-index notation on the array.
				myShapeType = myShape.shape;         //Using dot notation on the object.
				myShapeColor = myShape["color"];     //Using array-index notation on the object
				
				</CodeText>
				</CodeExample>		
				
				<Paragraph>A similar named array in the .JSON file use the following syntax, where "shapes" is wrapped in an object: </Paragraph>
				
				<CodeExample>
				<CodeText>
				
				{"shapes" : 
				[ {"color": "green", "shape":"square"},
				  {"color": "red", "shape":"circle"}, 
				  {"color": "blue", "shape":"triangle"}] 
				} 
				
				</CodeText></CodeExample>			 
	  
				<Paragraph>The array can also be stored without a name, like this:</Paragraph>
					
				<CodeExample>
				<CodeText>
				
				 [{"color": "green", "shape":"square"},
				  {"color": "red", "shape":"circle"}, 
				  {"color": "blue", "shape":"triangle"} ] 
				
				</CodeText>
				</CodeExample>	

				<Paragraph>It is possible to iterate over the contents of the array and access each of the elements.
				   This can be done using a for loop or using the forEach()  function (Array.prototype.forEach())</Paragraph>
				
				<CodeExample>
				<CodeText>
				
				 /*Use for-loop to log the color and shape */
				 for (var i = 0; i &lt;shapes.length; ++i)
				 {
					console.log(shapes[i].color);
					console.log(shapes[i].shape);
				 }
				 
				 /*Similar result using forEach() where
				   element points to current element in array*/
				  shapes.forEach(function(element)
				 {
					console.log(element.color);
					console.log(element.shape);
				 }
				
				</CodeText>

				<SubsectionHeading>Getting JSON Data Using AJAX</SubsectionHeading>
				
				<Paragraph>The basic concept behind AJAX, or Asynchronous Javascript with XML is to request and process response data from the server
				without reloading the page. Although the name suggests that AJAX only works with XML, this is not true. it is only one of its uses.
				Notably, AJAX can be used to retrieve JSON data as well. As mentioned briefly in the introduction, AJAX improves the responsiveness of
				web applications significantly. It also means that the entire page is not cleared, given that no page reload is required. This means
				that content like inputs do not have to be</Paragraph>
				
				<Paragraph>I've included a brief example below that shows how to create an XMLHttpRequest object. This object handles the request which is sent to
				the server. The basic idea is to create the object, attach an event listener which processes the response data, open the GET request,
				and to then send the request to the server. Notice that no additional data needs to be sent with the request, as the GET request header
				includes the location of the JSON resource. So, a value of "null" is passed to the send() function.</Paragraph>
				
				
				<CodeExample>
				<CodeText>
				
			/* Creates an XMLHttpRequest object to retrieve JSON data from a particular location. Assigns 
			   appropriate event listner for the readystatechange event on this object and sets
			   callback. 
			   @param string indicating the location of the JSON data
			   @param callback function to assign to eventlistener for readystatechange event */
				function getJSONData(resource, callback)
				{
				  try
				  {
					 var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();    //Create request.
					 //Assign event listener for readystatechange event and pass xhr object to callback.
					 xhr.addEventListener("readystatechange",  
					 function() {
				    		callback(xhr)
					 }, false);        
						
					 xhr.open("GET", resource, true);     //Open the GET request and specify resource.
					 xhr.send(null);                      //Send request. 
						
				  } catch(exception)
				    {
					  alert("Error. Request unsuccessful");
				    }
			         }
				
				</CodeText>
				</CodeExample>
				
				<Paragraph>An important point here is the last argument to the open() method. It is set to true, which indicates that the
				request should be asynchronous. This means that the function returns immediately and does not wait for the request to finish. If the argument
				is false, then the function blocks the thread which called it until the request is finished. This can have a significant impact
				on performance. It will usually prevent user input until the request has finished, causing frustration for the user. At worst, the browser may appear
				unresponsive. So, in most cases, the last argument should be set to true and a callback function should be used which is invoked
				when needed.</Paragraph>
				
				<Paragraph>The callback function itself is also important. It is invoked when an event known as a "readystatechange" occurs. This means that the
				current state of the request has changed. This state is managed as the "readyState" attribute of the XMLHttpRequest object.
				When the value of "readyState" is 4, this means that the request has completed. This is checked within the callback function. However,
				the callback function also needs to check for the status code returned by the server. This is stored as the "status" attribute of the
				XMLHttpRequest object. If "status" is 200, this indicates that the data was returned successfully in the response. Other HTTP status
				codes in the 4xx category (such as the well-known "404 Not Found" error) are used to indicate different errors.</Paragraph>
				
				<Paragraph>If the request is successful and the data could be retrieved, the callback function extracts the data from the XMLHttpRequest object's
				"responseText" property. This holds the response as a DOMString. Finally, the data can be converted to an object be using the JSON.parse()
				function. After the data is stored in a variable, it could be processed further as a JavaScript object, in any way desired.
				Please see the example below which shows the callback function. </Paragraph>
				
				<CodeExample>
				<CodeText>
				function myCallback(request)
				{
					//Make sure readystate is 4 and status is 200
					if (request.readyState === 4 && request.status === 200)
					{
						//Get the JSON data as a DOMString.
						var returnedData = request.responseText;
						
						//Parse data and create an object.
						var parsedJSON = JSON.parse(returnedData);
						
						//Process data here
						//....
					}
				}
