				<Summary>
					<paragraph>
						One of the most useful features of HTML5 is that it includes several page structure elements which
						were not found in HTML4. These include &LT;header&GT;, &LT;nav&GT;, &LT;footer&GT;, &LT;Subsection&GT;, and &LT;article&GT;. 
					</paragraph>
					
					<paragraph>
						Using the new structure tags often offers advantages over the old &LT;div&GT; and &LT;span&GT; tags. This is because they have
						a much higher semantic value. In other words, they better describe the meaning and purpose of a given element. This allows the browser
						to distinguish different types of content and handle it appropriately. By contrast, &LT;div&GT; and &LT;span&GT; only tells the browser
						that the element is a block-level element, in the case of div, or an inline element, in the case of span. One example
						of where this is useful is for visually impaired or anyone uses a screen reader. The improved structure tags allow the screen reader
						to determine how or whether or not to include content in the output.
					</paragraph>	
					
					<paragraph>
						That being said, &LT;div&GT; and &LT;span&GT; are still useful when no appropriate semantic tag exists. For example,
						an arbitrary set of otherwise unelated elements may be wrapped in a containing &LT;div&GT;. This can be used element to 
						achieve positioning on the set of elements, and to define margins, visibility, and other properties.

			<Subsection>
				<SubsectionHeading>&LT;header&GT;</SubsectionHeading>
				<paragraph> This element is a container for the site's header. It will often contain &LT;h1&GT; elements used for the main
				site heading, as follows. </paragraph>
				
				<CodeExample>
				<CodeText>
				&LT;header&GT;
				  &LT;h1&GT;My Site Heading &LT;/h1&GT; 
				&LT;/header&GT;
				</CodeText>
				</CodeExample>
								
				<paragraph>However, additional &LT;header&GT; elements may also be used to contain subheadings within the page. 
				These subheadings can contain elements ranging from &LT;h2&GT; to &LT;h6&GT;, as well as descriptive text.
				For example, you could have: </paragraph>
				
				<CodeExample>
				<CodeText>
				&LT;header&GT;
				  &LT;h1&GT;My Site Heading &LT;/h1&GT; 
				&LT;/header&GT;
					
				&LT;header&GT;
				  &LT;h2&GT; Name of subheading &LT;/h2&GT; 
				  &LT;p&GT; Subsection description ................&LT;/p&GT; 
				&LT;/header&GT;
					
				&LT;header&GT;
				  &LT;h1&GT;Name of another subheading &LT;/h1&GT; 
				  &LT;p&GT; Subsection description &LT;/p&GT; 
				&LT;/header&GT;
				</CodeText>
				</CodeExample>
			</Subsection>
			
			<Subsection>
				 <SubsectionHeading>&LT;nav&GT;</SubsectionHeading>
				 <paragraph>The &LT;nav&GT; element represents a site's menu or other collections of navigation link such as an index. 
				 
				 It should be noted that this element is not intended as a container for all links on a page, only for 
				 significant sets of links in a group. A typical use of &LT;nav&GT; for a menu of links is shown below. A similar
				 structure could be used for a larger menu with submenus. These elements could be presented as drop-down menus, or in
				 a sidebar. </paragraph>
				 
				 <CodeExample>
				<CodeText>
				&LT;nav&GT;
				  &LT;a href = &quot;http://www.example.com&quot;&GT;Example &LT;/a&GT; 
				  &LT;a href = &quot;http://www.......&quot;&GT;Biz &LT;/a&GT;
			          &LT;a href = &quot;http://www.......&quot;&GT;Baz &LT;/a&GT;
				  &LT;a href = &quot;http://www.......&quot;&GT;Foo &LT;/a&GT;
			          &LT;a href = &quot;http://www.......&quot;&GT;Bar &LT;/a&GT;
				&LT;/nav&GT;
				</CodeText>
				</CodeExample>
				
				<paragraph>Controlling the presentation of the menu using CSS is relatively straightforward. For example, the links
				can be displayed in a horizontal navigation bar by setting the display property to "inline-block" for anchor
				elements within the nav. Additional styling can also be applied to each anchor element, such as width,
				height, background-color and font. Setting the display property to inline-block allows each anchor
				to behave like a block-level element and have its own width and margins. However, it still retains
				the characteristic of being displayed inline with other elements in the menu. Here is a simple illustration
				of this approach in CSS. </paragraph>
				
				<CodeExample>
				<CodeText>
				/*Display menu to be 50% width of parent. This could really be any value. Also set margins to 1em. */
				nav
				{
					width: 50%;
					margin: 3em;   /*Margins scale with font size*/
				}
				
				/*Style for anchor elements within a nav */
				nav a
				{
					display: inline-block;    /*Display as an inline-block level element*/
					border: 1px solid black;
					float: left;             /*No space between elements */
					min-height: 1.5em;      /*Minimum usable height, scale with font size */
					width: 6em;             /*Width scales with font size*/
					padding: 1em;           /*Padding around button text.*/
					font: bold 1/2em monospace;    /*Set font weight, size, and family*/
					margin: 0;
					background-color: dodgerblue;  /*Set background color to doger blue*/
					text-align: center;            /*Center text in button*/
				}
     			</CodeText>
				</CodeExample>
			
			  				
				<paragraph>The example above uses a "non-list" approach. Although it is no longer necessary to use a list, this
				is still a popular approach. The main reason is that, prior to HTML5, lists were a convenient container
				for links in menus. In addition, some older browsers did not apply styles to inline elements correctly. This older
				approach typically followed the following structure using an unordered list with each link (anchor) included
				within a &LT;li&GT; element. </paragraph>
				
				<CodeExample>
				<CodeText>
			   &LT;ul&GT;
			           &LT;li&gt; 
				     &LT;a href = &quot;http://www.example.com&quot;&GT;Example&LT;/a&GT; 
				   &LT;/li&gt; 
				   &LT;li&gt;
				      &LT;a href = &quot;http://www.......&quot;&GT;Biz &LT;/a&GT; 
				   &LT;/li&gt;
				   &LT;li&gt;
				      &LT;a href = &quot;http://www.......&quot;&GT;Baz &LT;/a&GT; 
				   &LT;/li&gt;
				   &LT;li&gt;
				      &LT;a href = &quot;http://www.......&quot;&GT;Foo &LT;/a&GT; 
				   &LT;/li&gt;
				   &LT;li&gt;
				      &LT;a href = &quot;http://www.......&quot;&GT;Bar &LT;/a&GT; 
				   &LT;/li&gt;	
			   &LT;/ul&GT;
				</CodeText>
				</CodeExample>
			</Subsection>
		
			<Subsection>
				<SubsectionHeading>&LT;footer&GT;</SubsectionHeading>
				
				<paragraph>As the name suggests, this tag holds content found in a document's footer. This includes information
				like contact details, a link to a sitemap, author information, copyright restrictions, and access to technical support. </paragraph>
				
				<CodeExample>
				<CodeText>
				&LT;footer&GT;
				   &LT;p&GT; 2017 ACME Corporation, All Rights Reserved&LT;/p&GT;
				   &LT;address&GT; 
				     12345 Example Drive &LT;br&GT;
				     Somewhere, State 0987 &LT;br&GT;
				     Elsewhere &LT;br&GT;
				   &LT;/address&GT;
				   &LT;p&GT; &LT;a href = &quot;http://www.example.com/contact.php&quot;&GT; Contact Us &LT;a&GT; &LT;/p&GT;
				   &LT;p&GT; &LT;a href = &quot;http://www.example.com/sitemap.php&quot;&GT; Site Map &LT;a&GT; &LT;/p&GT;
 
				 &LT;footer&GT;
				</CodeText>
				</CodeExample>
				
				<paragraph>While the above example illustrates is the typical use, it is also valid to have more than one footer in a document.
				This is similar to using multiple &LT;header&GT; elements for different Subsections.</paragraph>
		
			</Subsection>
			
			<Subsection>
				<SubsectionHeading>&LT;section&GT;</SubsectionHeading>
				
				<paragraph>The section element is a fairly general element, but not as general as div. It is used to separate groups
				of elements based on their theme. In other words, it should have semantically related content.
				In most cases, this means that each &LT;section&GT; should contain a h1-h6 (Eg. &LT;h2&GT;) element
				which naturally describes its theme, as shown in the example below. </paragraph>
				
				<paragraph>It is important to mention that the section element should not be used when there 
				is a more specific semantic tag that is applicable. For example, a set of links acting as a site index should usually be 
				placed in a &LT;nav&GT; container, rather than in a &LT;section&GT;</paragraph>
				
				<CodeExample>
				<CodeText>
				&LT;section&GT;
				   &LT;h2&GT; Getting started&LT;/h2&GT;
				   &LT;p&GT;Paragaph on how to get started&LT;/p&GT;
				   &LT;p&GT;Another paragraph on how to get started&LT;/p&GT;
				   &LT;p&GT;etc.&LT;/p&GT;
 				 &LT;/section&GT;
				 
				 &LT;section&GT;
				     &LT;h2&GT; Help available&LT;/h2&GT;
				     &LT;p&GT;Paragraph on help available&LT;/p&GT;
				   
				      &LT;ul&GT;
					   &LT;li&GT;Help resource&LT;/li&GT;
					   &LT;li&GT;Another help resource&LT;/li&GT;
					   <!--And so on -->
				     &LT;/ul&GT;
				   &LT;/section&GT;
					 
				 
				</CodeText>
				</CodeExample>
				
			</Subsection>
			
			<Subsection>
				<SubsectionHeading>&LT;article&GT;</SubsectionHeading>
				<paragraph>An article element can hold any content which could be published independently of the rest of the document. In other
				words, the element should still retain its meaning when used on its own. In a typical use-case, the site-wide banner,
				menu, and footer would not be part of the article element. This is the case in the following, based on the structure of this
				tutorial page:</paragraph>
				
				<CodeExample>
				<CodeText>
				&lt;header&gt;
				  &lt;h1&gt;Site Banner Text&lt;/h1&gt;
				&lt;/header&gt;
				&lt;article&gt;
				  &lt;h3&gt;HTML5 page-structure elements&lt;/h3&gt;
			
				  &lt;p&gt;One of the most useful features of HTML5 is that it includes several page structure elements which
				  were not found in HTML4. These include &amp;LT;header&amp;GT;, &amp;LT;nav&amp;GT;, &amp;LT;footer&amp;GT;, &amp;LT;Subsection&amp;GT;, and &amp;LT;article&amp;GT;. &lt;/p&gt;
				
				  &lt;Subsection&gt;
				    &lt;SubsectionHeading&gt;An HTML Element Name&lt;/SubsectionHeading&gt;
					&lt;p&gt;Info about element, and comparison to other elements...&lt;/p&gt;
					....
					....
				  &lt;/Subsection&gt;
				  
				  
				  &lt;Subsection&gt;
				    &lt;SubsectionHeading&gt;Another HTML Element Name&lt;/SubsectionHeading&gt;
					&lt;p&gt;.....&lt;/p&gt;
				  &lt;/Subsection&gt;
				  
				  ...
				  ...
				  
				&lt;/article&gt;
				
				
				&lt;footer&gt;Site-wide footer elements&lt;/footer&gt;
				</CodeText>
				</CodeExample>
				
				<paragraph>Another good example of a valid article element is a posting on a blog. While the posting is part of the blog's overall 
				document, this posting could be presented independently elsewhere.</paragraph>
				
				<paragraph>It is also possible to use nested article elements. In this case, the inner article element must relate to its
				parent article element. A very common instance of this would be comments on a news article published online. The
				article is obviously marked as an article element. However, the reader comments on the article can each be wrapped in nested
				article elements, as shown below. Here, each comment is in an article element which is in the Subsection with id "comments". Each
				comment article element has a header for user name (and possibly other info like posting time or user image), 
				and a p element for the actual comment contents.</paragraph>
				
				<CodeExample>
				<CodeText>
				&lt;article&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Rising Oil Prices Spark Tensions&lt;/h2&gt;
				  &lt;Subsection&gt;
				    &lt;h3&gt;Intro.....&lt;/h3&gt;
				  &lt;/Subsection&gt;
				  &lt;Subsection&gt;
				     &lt;h3&gt;President's response&lt;/h3&gt;
				     &lt;p&gt;After a late-night meeting with cabinet....&lt;/p&gt;
				     &lt;p&gt;.....&lt;/p&gt;
				     ....
				   &lt;/Subsection&gt;
				   &lt;Subsection&gt;
				     &lt;h3&gt;Other country's opinion&lt;/h3&gt;
				     &lt;p&gt;....&lt;/p&gt;
				     .....
				   &lt;/Subsection&gt;
				    ....
				 
				   &lt;Subsection id = &quot;comment-Subsection&quot;&gt;
				     &lt;h2&gt;Comments;&lt;/h2&gt;
				     &lt;article&gt;
				       &lt;header&gt;
					   &lt;h3&gt;User name: John Smith&lt;/h3&gt;
					   &lt;/header&gt;
					   &lt;p&gt;I think this article is great!.....&lt;/p&gt;
				 
				     &lt;/article&gt;
				   
				     &lt;article&gt;
				       &lt;header&gt;
					   &lt;h3&gt;User name: Jane Doe&lt;/h3&gt;
					   &lt;/header&gt;
					   &lt;p&gt;This is the most biased writing ever. The author....&lt;/p&gt;
				     &lt;/article&gt;
				   
				   				 
				      ....
				 	 
				   &lt;/Subsection&gt;
			    &lt;/article&gt;

			<SectionHeading id = "input-elements">HTML5 input elements</SectionHeading>
			<Summary>
				<paragraph>HTML 5 has several additional input types which make it easier to receive and validate data from users. All of these
				types are used by specifying the "type" attribute within the existing &LT;input&GT; tag. Although this type of validation is
				more limited than custom validation with JavaScript, it is much easier to use and offers a good first line of defense against
				input errors. Another advantage of this type of validation is that it is usually very fast, given that no data is sent to the server.</paragraph>
			</Summary>

				<SubsectionHeading>Date and Time Input with input type = datetime-local</SubsectionHeading>
				
				<paragraph>This input type offers the ability to get date and time data from the user in a uniform format. This format is
				YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm. For example, 11am on 30 October, 2017 would be 2017-10-30T11:00. Many browsers offer a convenient date and time
				picker to allow users to easily enter this information without having to worry about input format. This input type can be
				utilized in a form, as shown below, or as an independent input.</paragraph>
			
				<CodeExample>
				<CodeText>
				&lt;form&gt;
				  ...
				  &lt;label for = &quot;birth-date&quot;&gt;Date of birth: &lt;/label&gt;
				  &lt;input type = &quot;datetime-local&quot; id = &quot;birth-date&quot; name = &quot;dateOfBirth&quot;&gt;
				  ...
				
				  &lt;input type = &quot;submit&quot; value = &quot;submit&quot;&gt;
				&lt;/form&gt;
				</CodeText>
				
				<Outputfigure>
				<Image> images/datetime-local-chrome.jpg </Image>
				<Caption>Date-picker in Google Chrome (above)</Caption>
				</Outputfigure>
				</CodeExample>
				<paragraph>The main problem with the datetime-local input type is that it is not fully supported across all browsers. As of now,
				a notable example is Firefox, which does not support this input type. This means that the input falls back to a simple
				text input type. The type becomes the same as type = "text" Since no date picker is provided,
				the user will be required to enter date and time manually in exactly the "YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm" format, increasing the chance of input errors significantly.
				One workaround for this problem is to avoid the datetime-local type altogether and use several &LT;select&GT; drop-down menus with &LT;option&GT; elements for
				the year, month, day, and time (if required). </paragraph>
				
				<CodeExample>
				<CodeText>
				&lt;form&gt;
				...
				
				&lt;label for = &quot;day&quot;&gt;Day&lt;/label&gt;
				&lt;select&gt;
					&lt;option&gt;1&lt;/option&gt;
					&lt;option&gt;2&lt;/option&gt;
					&lt;option&gt;3&lt;/option&gt;
					&lt;option&gt;4&lt;/option&gt;
					&lt;option&gt;5&lt;/option&gt;
					...
					...
				&lt;/select&gt;
				
				&lt;label for = &quot;month&quot;&gt;Month&lt;/label&gt;
				&lt;select&gt;
					&lt;option&gt;January&lt;/option&gt;
					&lt;option&gt;February&lt;/option&gt;
					&lt;option&gt;March&lt;/option&gt;
					...
					&lt;option&gt;December&lt;/option&gt;
				&lt;/select&gt;
				
				&lt;label for = &quot;year&quot;&gt;Year&lt;/label&gt;
				&lt;select&gt;
					&lt;option&gt;1930&lt;/option&gt;
					&lt;option&gt;1931&lt;/option&gt;
					&lt;option&gt;1932&lt;/option&gt;
					...
					...
					&lt;option&gt;2016&lt;/option&gt;
				&lt;/select&gt;
				
				&lt;!--If time is required as well, the following can also be included --&gt;
				&lt;label for = &quot;hour&quot;&gt;Hour&lt;/label&gt;
				&lt;select&gt;
					&lt;option&gt;1&lt;/option&gt;
					&lt;option&gt;2&lt;/option&gt;
					&lt;option&gt;3&lt;/option&gt;
					...
					...
					&lt;option&gt;12&lt;/option&gt;
				&lt;/select&gt;
				
				&lt;label for = &quot;minute&quot;&gt;Minute&lt;/label&gt;
				&lt;select&gt;
					&lt;option&gt;00&lt;/option&gt;
					&lt;option&gt;05&lt;/option&gt;
					&lt;option&gt;10&lt;/option&gt;
					...
					...
					&lt;option&gt;55&lt;/option&gt;
				&lt;/select&gt;
				
				&lt;select&gt;
					&lt;option&gt;AM&lt;/option&gt;
					&lt;option&gt;PM&lt;/option&gt;
				&lt;/select&gt;
				...
				
				&lt;input type = &quot;submit&quot; value = &quot;submit&quot;&gt;
				&lt;/form&gt;
				</CodeText>
				</CodeExample>
				
				<paragraph>The drawback of this approach is that it makes the solution significantly more complex since we
				need to consider that each month will have a different number of days. There are also other issues to consider, such as different time formats and
				date formats in different regions of the world. It would be possible to hard-code every single possible combination
				of day and month, but this would be extremely tedious and difficult to maintain. The obvious solution is to use JavaScript to generate the
				correct set of options. This can be accomplished using a library like jQuery with plugins like Datapicker: <Location>https://jqueryui.com/datepicker/"</<Location> .
				For an example of implementing your own solution in JavaScript, please see <Location>https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/datetime-local</Location>

			<SubsectionHeading>Number Input with input type = "number"</SubsectionHeading>
			<paragraph> This type of input element takes an integer or floating-point number value. Unlike the datetime-local input type, the number input type is well supported 
			across all popular browsers. It is also more straightforward to use. Most browsers display a number input with up and down buttons for easily increasing
			or decreasing the value. Users can also type a value directly in the input field.
			</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Various restrictions can be imposed on number inputs. Most notably, the minimum and maximum values with the "min" and "max" attributes, respectively. In addition, the
			step size of each click on the up and down arrows can be specified using the "step" attribute. It is also possible to set a default value, which is the starting value 
			of the input field. This is done using the "value" attribute. The example below shows each of these attributes.</paragraph>
			
			<CodeExample>
			<CodeText>
			&lt;!--Set the input to type number, with a minimum value of 0 
			and a maximum value of 10. The step size for each button click 
			on the input's arrows is 1 and the starting value is 1 --&gt;
			
			&lt;input type = &quot;number&quot; name = &quot;number-input&quot; min = &quot;0&quot; 
			  max = &quot;10&quot; step = &quot;1&quot; value = &quot;1&quot;&gt;
			
			</CodeText>
			
			<paragraph>This produces the following input field in Firefox:</paragraph>

			<Subsection>
				<SubsectionHeading>Range Input with input type = "range"</SubsectionHeading>
				
				<paragraph>Besides the number type, another useful type for getting numeric input is the range input type. This type is most appropriate when
				the precise value is not required. Rather, an approximate value somewhere within the range of values is desired. </paragraph>
				
				<paragraph>Much like the number type, it is possible to specify a minimum ("min" attribute) and maximum ("max" attribute) for the range
				input type. It is also possible to specify granularity of the range input using the "step" attribute. Most browsers will show the range
				input as a slider control, so the "step" attribute will control how fine the control is. In other words, how much movement is required
				to increase the input value, and by how much. The following example shows a range input with a minimum value of 1 and a maximum value of 20.
				The "step" attribute is 1 so around 1/20<sup>th</sup> of the width of the control will increase or decrease the value by 1.</paragraph>
				
				<CodeExample>
				<CodeText>
				&lt;label for = &quot;range-input&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; 
				  &lt;input type = &quot;range&quot; min = &quot;1&quot; max = &quot;20&quot; step = &quot;1&quot; id = &quot;range-input&quot;&gt;&lt;/input&gt;

				<SubsectionHeading>Email Input with input type = "email"</SubsectionHeading>
				
				<paragraph>As the name indicates, the e-mail input type is intended for entry of e-mail addresses. This is extremely useful in any use-case
				where we must be able to contact users later. Examples include order forms, newsletter subscriptions, and technical support requests.
				Email addresses are also used frequently in login screens in place of (or in addition to) usernames and for password recovery.</paragraph>
				
				<paragraph>Several attributes can be specified for this type. These include the "minlength" and "maxlength" attributes which determine
				allowed minimum and maximum length on input, respectively. Another useful attribute is "placeholder" which displays some value
				before the element gain focus (user interacts with it), typically a dummy e-mail address. This helps the user to see the correct
				format to use. We can also specify the "pattern" attribute, which takes a regular expression for the correct format
				for an e-mail address and is used for validation. However, this is not required in many cases. The following example
				shows how to create an e-mail input and how to use it to validate an e-mail.</paragraph>
				
				<CodeExample>
				<CodeText>
			&lt;label for = &quot;email-field&quot;&gt;E-mail: &lt;/label&gt;
	         	&lt;input id = &quot;email-field&quot;  name = &quot;email-input&quot; type = &quot;email&quot; minlength = &quot;3&quot; 
				     maxlength = &quot;100&quot; placeholder = &quot;myname@example.com&quot;/&gt;

				<paragraph>Most browsers handle the e-mail input type works as expected. E-mail addresses are validated, and the user is notified if they
				have entered an invalid format. Unfortunately, some browsers do not support e-mail addresses with non-Latin characters. They will either
				mark these e-mail addresses as invalid or they will automatically convert certain characters to Latin characters before sending form
				data to the server. The latter is the case with the Google Chrome. This means that the e-mail input should be used with caution as it
				may limit internationalization. </paragraph>

				<SubsectionHeading>Selecting Color Input with input type = "color"</SubsectionHeading>
				
				<paragraph>This input type is somewhat different from the ones discussed so far. It allows users to select a specific color. While this
				color is stored as a string for a hexadecimal format color, some browsers allow users to select from a color palette which
				is actually the operating system's default color picker.
				Other browsers like Safari and Opera require that users enter a valid hexadecimal color code (Eg. #ff0000) but they do not show a color palette.
				This value will be validated. Unfortunately, Internet Explorer offers no support for this input type, which means that it will fall back to the
				default "text" type. However, Microsoft's more recent Edge browser now offers basic support for input type = "color". </paragraph>
				
				<paragraph>One of the attributes which can be specified for this input type is the "value" attribute. This sets the initial color to the specified value. This
				 attribute is also used to store the user's selection, as is the case for many input elements.</paragraph>
				
				<CodeExample>
				<CodeText>
			&lt;label for = &quot;color-field&quot;&gt;Color &lt;/label&gt;
			&lt;input id = &quot;color-field&quot; name = &quot;color-input&quot; type = &quot;color&quot; /&gt;
		     &lt;input type = &quot;submit&quot; name = &quot;submit-button&quot; value = &quot;submit&quot;&gt;

				<SubsectionHeading>Search queries with input type = "search"</SubsectionHeading>
				<paragraph>Compared to other HTML5 input types, search is probably the least complex. Validation is handled in the same way as text, so any characters are allowed. 
				   The main difference is that browsers will usually display this input in a different way then the normal text input. For example, Google chrome displays a list of 
				   previous searches if the user has used the input previously. As in the case of other input types, the "minLength" and maxLength attributes can be used to control the 
				   length of the search term. It is also possible to specify a placeholder text which is displayed before input is entered. This is done using the "placeholder" attribute. 
				   As you can see here, the syntax is the same as for other input types. The length is limited to between 1 and 100 characters.
				</paragraph>
				   
				 					
				<CodeExample>
				<CodeText>
			&lt;label for = &quot;search-field&quot;&gt;Search &lt;/label&gt;
			&lt;input id = &quot;search-field&quot; name = &quot;search-input&quot; type = &quot;search&quot; 
				minLength = &quot;1&quot; maxLength = &quot;100&quot;/&gt;
				&lt;input type = &quot;submit&quot; name = &quot;submit-button&quot; value = &quot;submit&quot;&gt;
				</CodeText>
				
				
				<Outputfigure>
				<Image> images/search-chrome.jpg</Image>
				<Caption>Google Chrome displays the following list which contains search terms where the first n characters match the input, where n is the length of the input. 
				  This provides a shortcut to access previously entered searches.</Caption>
